              Known for their jaw-dropping speed, striking coats, and unique
              social behaviours, these cats are full of surprises, but behind
              their beauty lies a species racing against extinction.

            Tan with distinctive black spots and dark “tear marks” running from
            the eyes to the mouth, cheetahs are built for speed rather than
            strength. Their slender bodies, deep chests, and long tails help
            them balance while sprinting and making sharp turns. Unlike other
            big cats, cheetahs rely on explosive acceleration to chase down prey
            such as gazelles in short, high-speed bursts across open terrain.
